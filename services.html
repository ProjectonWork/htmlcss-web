                               <p>We do much more than web design. Web development takes things a step further. It can involve anything from content development to coding, markup to server scripting and network security configuration. Whatever you need, you can trust us to give you common sense, plain language advice.</p>
                               <p>What’s the difference between web design and development? The design process is all about generating jpgs, specifying the fonts, colours, layout and images. Development means actually coding the design and turning it into a beautiful working website.</p>
                               <p>This means you could come to us with a set of Photoshop designs you want developing into a website. Or we could carry out the design and development for you. That’s what we call flexibility!</p>

                               <p>More than a third of all internet traffic is on a hand held device, and mobile access is set to overtake desktop sometime during 2015. Some suspect it has already happened. Which is why we take such care to ensure every site we build or redesign is fully responsive, working just as perfectly on a small screen as on a desktop PC.</p>
                               <p>We create beautiful, fully-functional, original, influential websites from scratch. We do website redesign too, transforming tired websites past their sell-by date to give your business a fresh new face, while retaining all the search engine optimisation goodness they attracted during their lifetime.And they’re future proof, vital when mobile internet access is growing by the day.And they’re future proof, vital when mobile internet access is growing by the day.</p>

Whether you want stationery, a logo, full branding, brochures or something else altogether, our design excellence means we’ll deliver a compelling brand identity that’s both beautiful and successful.</p>

                               <p>We practice differentiated development in order to maximize the experience for devices with higher OS versions or higher capacity. Most apps consist of a mobile part and a backend which we either build directly on top of our easy to use free CMS Nodescamp or integrated onto already existing frameworks or APIs.</p>
